Welcome to my first blog created using the Hugo site generator and published as a GitHub site. I plan to write on different topics like:

 - JavaScript
 - Functional vs Object Oriented programming patterns
 - Data Science
 - Web technologies
 - or anything else that pique my interest to write about it.
